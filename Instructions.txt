Instructions for running HD Gesture recognition using Cerebro
-------------------------------------------------------------
This instruction is for setting up the code on Ubuntu. 
Our board's name is 'CerebroBRD Fine Mondo 1000' with MAC '00:07:80:7C:87:D3'.
These values may be different if another board is used.	Please use those newer values instead.
	
In the demo computer, the following steps should be done:

1. All .m files should be located in this README's directory. Originally, this was
	scheduled in ~/sonic_y4_annual_demo/cerebro/

2. A quicker way to check that device is connected and paired is to run bluetoothctl and find the line:
		[NEW] Device 00:07:80:7C:87:D3 CerebroBRD Fine Mondo 1000
	If this line exists, skip to step 4.

3. Run the following setup commands for pairing the device (yet to automate bluetoothctl):

		bluetoothctl
	
	A bluetoothctl prompt should appear. Inside bluetoothctl, run the following:

		power on
		agent KeyboardOnly
		default-agent
		agent on
		scan on
		pair 00:07:80:7C:87:D3
		trust 00:07:80:7C:87:D3

	Quit bluetoothctl.

4.	Ensure that the output of:

		sudo rfcomm -a

	is NULL to check that rfcomm0 is not used.
	
	If not, run:

		sudo rfcomm unbind all
		sudo rfcomm release all
	
	Sometimes running above commands return a message saying that the operation is already
	in progress/not completed yet. This is because another process using this locked 
	this resource and created a lock file in '/var/lock/' folder which it didn't clear.
	For 'rfcomm0', the lock will be '/var/lock/LCK..rfcomm0' containing the PID of that process.
	Kill that process using the PID if it exists, else manually this stale lock file.
	Then, re-run the last two commands.
	
5. Finally, bind the device to the port rfcomm0		

		sudo rfcomm bind rfcomm0 00:07:80:7C:87:D3 


6. Move/create a matlab interactive process in this directory.

7. Run 'main'. The Demo software must have started.
